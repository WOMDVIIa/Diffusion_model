# Diffusion_model
When presenting my skills I mention Diffusion Model written in C++. Initially I resisted to share it since creating it costed me a lot of time and effort. Now I reconsidered and if there is a chance it would bring me closer to finding new job then here it is.
Initially it was much cleaner but the closer it was getting to the end the messier it became since I wanted and needed to finish it ASAP.
